# Versioning Convention

After [release 1.0.0.4](https://github.com/fisothemes/LabVIEW-TwinCAT-ADS/releases/tag/1.0.0.4) versioning of this Toolkit/API will follow this format: `<Major>.<Release>.<Pre-release>.<Build>`.

* **Major version**

    The major version number is incremented when there is a significant change to the project that makes it incompatible with previous versions. This could include changes to the Toolkit/API, the underlying architecture, or the overall functionality of the project.

* **Release version**

    The release version number is incremented when a new stable version of the project is released. This version should be relatively bug-free and ready for use by end users.

* **Pre-release version**

    The pre-release version number is incremented when a new version of the project is released that is not yet stable. This version may contain bugs or other issues that need to be fixed before it can be released to the public.

* **Build number**

    The build number is incremented each time the project is built. This number is not used to track changes to the project, but rather to track the progress of the build process. It will only be reset after the major version has changed.
